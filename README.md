# ‚ö†Ô∏èReal Word Problem!!

College students usually rely on pocket money from their families as their primary source of income.
Most of this money is spent through UPI transactions, but students often spend without tracking where the money goes or why it was spent. 
This lack of financial awareness leads to poor money management habit.

It extracts transactions from bank statements, categorizes them, visualizes spending patterns, and even provides AI-powered financial insights through a chatbot.
